I am a computer scientist born in Bolzano, South Tyrol. I discovered my passion for computer science at a young age and started studying it in high school at 14 years old.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Verona in July 2022, with a grade of 108/110.
During my final year of the B.Sc. program, I also worked as a teacher at the same high school where I graduated.

Currently, I am pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree (M.Sc.) in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Verona.

During my studies, I have gained experience as a tutor, teaching various subjects to undergraduate students in the B.Sc. in Computer Science, Bioinformatics and Applied Mathematics program at the same university.

Additionally, I participated in an Erasmus exchange program for one semester, attending courses in Intelligent Systems and Numerical Applications in Engineering at ULPGC.
